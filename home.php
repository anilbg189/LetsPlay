    <p class="aboutcontent">Let's Play is a 1-stop platform for sports lovers that helps sports enthusiasts connect with each other, facilities and academies. 

This website's intent is to help people reconnect with sports in their adult life. Almost all of us have played some sport in our childhood and typically have happy and carefree playfield memories associated to it. It is unfortunate then, that as we grow up, this link to active sports is lost over time due to lack of easy access to fellow players and infrastructure. This website addresses this need by providing a social platform for sports enthusiasts coupled with convenient online reservations and discovery of sports venues around them on an hourly basis.
